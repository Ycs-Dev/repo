It features a modern UI that emphasises native UI elements, with fully native package depictions on supported repos! It also allows repositories to handle payments seamlessly and natively on iOS 12, with payments secured by Touch/Face ID.\n\nSileo uses the latest versions of both DPKG and APT to ensure that users get the best possible experience with the latest optimizations and stability fixes applied for both. Both DPKG and APT have minimal patches to ensure they may continue to be updated, while still being compatible with most existing iOS repositories.",

Many infrequently-used APT features have not been brought over to Cystore to keep it lean and fast, with the BigBoss repo being passed through a filter so users may still access the packages they still want, without CyStore being bogged down with packages that weren't updated for iOS 9 or higher.\n\n#### Integrated\n\nBecause Sileo has been built with Chimera, Tweak Injector and the latest DPKG and APT in mind, they all have been updated to ensure they work together in the most efficient manner possible. Great effort has been taken to ensure that the entire process from app launch to package installation has been streamlined, with no processes being duplicated where possible, to ensure a better, faster, and more stable overall experience.\n\n#### Free\n\nCyStore is available, free of charge, for all iOS 12 devices running the Chimera jailbreak.",
